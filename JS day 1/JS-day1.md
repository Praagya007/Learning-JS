Day 01 – Notes
🧠 Statement vs Expression
✅ Statement
A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action. It doesn't necessarily return a value.

Example:
let x = 5; // variable declaration (a statement)
✅ Expression
An expression is any code that produces a value. Expressions can be used inside statements.

Example:
x + 3 // This is an expression. It evaluates to 8 (if x = 5)
Example inside a statement:

let y = x + 3; // The expression (x + 3) is used inside a statement

🛠️ Debugging in JavaScript
🔹 What is a Breakpoint?
A breakpoint is a marker you set in your code to pause execution at a specific line.

This lets you see how your code is running, step-by-step.

You can pause before or after certain lines to check variable values or logic.

🔹 What is Step Over?
"Step Over" means running the current line and moving to the next one, without entering functions.

Useful for going through logic quickly without diving deep into every function call.

🔹 What is a Watch Expression?
A watch expression lets you track the value of a variable (or any expression) while the code is paused.

Helps you see how variables change as the code runs.

Can add expressions like x, y, or even x * y.

🧪 What I Learned
Breakpoints help visualize how JavaScript runs.

Step Over gives control to run code one line at a time.

Watch Expressions are a powerful way to inspect variable values and debug logic.

Even though these seem advanced, they are basic tools to understand how code flows.
